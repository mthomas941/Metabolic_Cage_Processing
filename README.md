# Metabolic_Cage_Processing

This program will take in two files (one for each 8 cage experiment run), an animal numer list, and the corresponding genotypes.  Next, the program will add in animal numbers/genotypes, drop starting, ending, or both rows until the start/end times are approximately equal, concat the dataframes, and generate a new, processed .csv file.
